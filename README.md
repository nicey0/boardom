This shouldn't be a project of any significance. If it was my choice, you wouldn't be reading this sentence since the repo would be private. This is 100% free (and worthless!) code, by the way.
The cost of viewing is constructive feedback for me, please be nice & helpful, not judgemental. I know most of this is garbage at the moment, but hey, you had to start somewhere too, eh?

This is meant to eventually be a python implementation of a chess engine, using no "imports". Cheers.
